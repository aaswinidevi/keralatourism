 <h2>About District</h2>
 <br>
 <p class="container">Pathanamthitta District, the thirteenth revenue district of the State of Kerala, nestles its head on the slopes of the Western Ghats and stretches to the low-lying rice fields bordering Alappuzha District. It was formed with effect from the 1st November, 1982 vide G.O. (M.S) No.1026/82/RD dated 29.10.1982, with headquarters at Pathanamthitta. It is bounded on the North by Changanassery and Kanjirappally Taluks of Kottayam District and Peerumade Taluk of Idukki District, on the East by the State of Tamil Nadu, on the South by Kunnathur, Pathanapuram and Kottarakkara Taluks of Kollam District and on the West by Chengannur, Mavelikkara and Kuttanad Taluks of Alappuzha District. It abounds with natural splendours – undulating hills, dark mysterious forests, exotic wildlife and enchanting valleys.</p>
    <p class="container">The district can be proud of its rich contribution to the struggle for freedom. When Mahatma Gandhi visited the restwhile Travencore in 1937, he asked his follower Khadar Das T.P.Gopala Pillai to spread the message of Khadi and Charka. Inspired by Gandhiji he founded the ‘Mahatma Khadi Ashram’ at Elanthoor in 1941. He launched a scheme for mobilizing funds for khadi activities known as ‘ek paise fund’ in order to ensure the participation of the whole people in the Khadi Movement. The District has prominent role in the freedom struggle of the Country. Shri.K.E. Maman and Shri.K.A.Mathew are among the well-known freedom fighters who hail from Thiruvalla which belongs to Pathanamthitta District. After India became independent, the popular ministry was installed in Travancore on the 24th March, 1948. On the 1st July, 1949, Travancore and Cochin States were integrated and the Maharaja of Travancore became Rajpramukh of Travancore-Cochin State and this position continued till the formation of Kerala State on the 1st November, 1956, as per the States Reorganization Act, 1956. The District came into existence as a separate administrative unit on the 1st November, 1982 as stated earlier.</p>
