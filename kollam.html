 <h2>About District</h2>
 <br>
 <p class="container">    Kollam prides in a rich socio-cultural history from ancient times. It had been a hub of royal administration while being the capital of the ancient Venad province during 9th to 12th centuries C.E. Its proximity to the sea and the presence of the natural harbour at Neendakara had occasioned commercial transactions with foreigners from ancient times. References to Kollam can be found in Roman and Phoenecian accounts from the first century C.E. In later times, it finds mention in the travel writings of the Chinese, Arabs and Europeans like Muhammad Ibn Battuta, Sulaiman Al- Tajir and Marco Polo dating from 9th century onwards. The oldest name of Kollam is “Desinganadu” after the king Jayasimha from whom the Venad dynasty is supposed to have originated. The name Kollam has a long etymology bearing the marks of the place’s history spanning centuries. One theory has it that the name Kollam derives from the Sanskrit “kollam,” which means pepper, because the place had been an ancient trading and exporting centre for pepper. “Kollam” is also supposed have formed from “koyillam”, a telescoping of kovilakam (palace) and illam (brahmin house). Some believe that “Kollam” comes from the Chinese word “kolasam” meaning a big market. Yet another theory proposes that the Sanskrit “kollam” also meant a boat, and the place got its name owing to is being a port town where boats were harboured.</p>
 <p class="container">Kollam got its first ever post and telegraph office in 1864 and the first school in 1867. The Punalur suspension bridge, the only one of its kind in India other than the Howrah bridge of Kolkota, is situated in Kollam district. A living marvel of British engineering, the bridge was commissioned in 1877 upon the initiative of Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal of Travancore. The first government hospital at Kollam, Victoria Hospital, started functioning during the reign of Maharaja Sreemoolam Thirunal. Electricity came in 1924. Kollam also holds the unique position of having been the first airport in Kerala until the commissioning of the Trivandrum airport in 1932. Located in the open spaces of the Ashramam maidan at the heart of the city, its runway could accommodate the traffic of light aircrafts. The first railway in Travancore was the meter gauge track between Kollam and Shenkottai in Tamil Nadu commissioned in 1902 during the reign of Maharaja Uthram Thirunal.</p>
