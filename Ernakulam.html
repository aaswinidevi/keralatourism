 <h2>About District</h2>
 <br>
 <p class="container">     Ernakulam District came into being in 1958 April 1 by incorporating Kanayannoor, Kochi, Kunnathunadu, Aluva and Paroor Taluks. Deliberation for hours held at the Kerala Fine Arts Hall in 1957 and attended by a host of political, social and media activists was instrumental in the formation of the District.

    The etymology of the term ‘Ernakulam’ is linked to different sources, either temple-oriented or mythological. KomattilAchutha Menon attributes the origin of the word from a type of mud called ‘Erangiyal’. Lord Siva was addressed in Chennai as ‘Erayanar’in the past. In Kerala too, this was followed and it later came to be known as ‘Ernakulam’. Ebanubathootha who travelled along the Kerala coast between AD 1342 and AD 1347 did not even make a casual reference to Kochi. The name ‘Kochi’ is a combination of two terms, Koch&Azhi (small river-mouth).</p>
    <p class="container">The district is endowed with a rich flora and fauna spread over the mainland and the hinterlands. Two backwaters and three major rivers have been instrumental in the agricultural, industrial and trade development of Ernakulam. Although the construction of huge overbridges such as the Goshree and Varapuzha in recent years have reduced the importance of water-transportation it is still a great attraction for the domestic and international tourists. Monsoon has not been unkind to Ernakulam District all these years. Mangrove forests here come to around 465 square KMs. The foothill areas such as Kodanad and Kothamangalam have a relatively stable eco-system. Besides paddy and coconuts, cash crops too are produced in the district. Ernakulam is the biggest pineapple producing district in Kerala. Two bird sanctuaries in the district, Thattekkad and Mangalavanam, are shelter to the endangered species of birds and primordial spiders.</p>
